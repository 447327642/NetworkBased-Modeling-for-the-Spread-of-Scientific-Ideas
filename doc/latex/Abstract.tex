Using simulations, we investigated the changes in networks with nodes that held different `scientific ideas' and influenced each other through a complex contagion mechanism. This was divided into two parts: by varying the network structure and observing features of the distribution of ideas in networks, and by varying the starting idea distributions of the nodes and observing features of the network structures. The update step included a rewiring probability, a complex contagion threshold, and a probability of innovation (producing a new idea). We found that both structures and idea distributions influenced each other's features. Values of the update parameter also played a role.
