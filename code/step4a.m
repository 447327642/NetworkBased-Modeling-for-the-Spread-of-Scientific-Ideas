function clust_coeff = step4a( mat )
% This function calculates the clustering coefficient of a network with
% Corresponding connectivity matrix: mat
% The approach used for calculation of clustering coeffient was the one which was proposed by Watts and Strogatz 
% in which the clustering coeffient of the whole network equals to the
% average of the local clustering coeefient of all nodes:
